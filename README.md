# three-body-problem
In this project you can see my (not perfect) attempt to simulate the three body problem.
Check the classes for documentation. 
To start the simulation you can modify the values in the input.txt and hit the play button.
This is the order for the input: mass, x-position, y-position, x-speed, y-speed, x-acceleration, y-acceleration
